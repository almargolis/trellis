### QuickDev Development Environment

QuickDev is a collection of tools that helps me build system the way that I like to. It is a closed source, personal project at this time. I am documenting it here because this site is becoming the home of all my notes. If I detect any interest in other people wanting to use and support the project, I am open to responding to that.

**qdstart.py** initializes a project directory for Quickdev.

python3 <path to quickdev>/qdutils/qdstart.py
